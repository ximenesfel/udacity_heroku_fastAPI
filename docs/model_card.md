For additional information see the Model Card paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03993.pdf

## Model Details

Felipe Ximenes Viana created the model. It is Gradient Boosting Classifier based in scikit-learn library.

## Intended Use

This model should be used to predict the salary of a person based on attributes about it's financials.

## Training Data

The model was trained using 80% of this data.

## Evaluation Data

The model was evaluated using 20% of this data.

## Metrics

The model was evaluated using the accuracy score. The value is around 0.825.

## Ethical Considerations

Dataset contains data related race, gender and origin country. This may drive the model to be bias considering 

## Caveats and Recommendations

Further work needed to evaluate across a spectrum of genders.
